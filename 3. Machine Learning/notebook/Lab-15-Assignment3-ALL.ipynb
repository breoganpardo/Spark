    "When creating ML models, the concept of efficiency has three sides:\n",
    "1. The time dedicated by the analyst to build the model\n",
    "2. The computer time and resources needed by the final model\n",
    "3. The accuracy of the final model\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficiency is a combination of all\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you are asked to be efficient. Spark is the best tool to build models over massive datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to create Spark+Python Machine Learning models that \"run fast\" on the  cluster, you must avoid using Python code or working with RRD+python. Try to use  the already existing methods that do what you need (do not reinvent the wheel).\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore try to use the implemented object+methods inside the Spark SQL and ML modules. They are very fast, because it is compiled Java/Scala code. Try to use: DataFrames, Feature Transfomers, Estimators, Pipelines, GridSearch, CV, ...\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, you are asked to create a classification model that:\n",
    "1. Uses the variables in the dataset (train.csv) to predict label \"loan_status\"\n",
    "2. Write a python scripts that:\n",
    "    - Reads the \"train.csv\" and \"test.csv\" files, transform and select variables as you wish.\n",
    "    - Train/fit your model using the \"train.csv\".\n",
    "    - Predict your model on the \"test.csv\" ( you should generate a file with your predictions).\n",
    "    - I will use a different test dataset (with the true loan_status).\n",
    "\n",
    "Your work will be evaluated under the following scoring schema\n",
    "- (40%) ETL process\n",
    "- (40%) Model train process\n",
    "- (10%) Code Readability \n",
    "- (10%) AUC on the test set (at least 50%)\n",
    "\n",
    "Enjoy it and best of luck!!\n"
